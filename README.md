A simple command-line task tracker built in Python using SQLite. Built as a learning project to practice Python, SQL basics, and version control.

\## Tech

\- Python 3

\- SQLite (built-in via `sqlite3`)

\## How to run

```bash

py main.py


What I learned:

 	Writing in basic SQL (Create, Insert, Select, Update, Delete)
 	Separating app logic (main.py) from database logic (db.py)
 	Made a Git workflow: branch-> commit -> merge -> push

Next improvements:
 	Search tasks by keyword 
 	Edit a task (title/due date/priority)
 	Add basic tests
